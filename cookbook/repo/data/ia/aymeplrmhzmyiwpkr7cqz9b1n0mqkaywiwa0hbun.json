A three-time All-American, Schlatter moved off the Gopher coaching staff to take over as the main RTC freestyle coach.We'll talk to Schlatter about his transition, why he and older brother C.P. chose Minnesota, coaching Gable Steveson at the Junior World Championships and the dynamic that brothers on the same team can create, both individually and within a team setting.SUBSCRIBE TO THE GUILLOTINE GRAPEVINEApple Podcasts: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/guillotine-grapevine-podcast/id1032548516?at=11ly5XStitcher: http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/mat-talk-podcast-network/the-guillotine-grapevine-mat-talk-podcast-network?refid=stprSpreaker: http://www.spreaker.com/show/the-guillotine-grapevineSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/4VKmfx02sKGNFKyPa1koFb?si=u-Ks2gvKQbmbPWjroWON2QGoogle Play Music: https://play.google.com/music/m/Ifu46r7ti5hq4f6c54j43jtwb24?t=The_Guillotine_Grapevine_The_Podcast_for_the_Land_of_10000_Wrestlers__Mat_Talk_Podcast_NetworkRSS: https://www.spreaker.com/show/1498950/episodes/feed",
