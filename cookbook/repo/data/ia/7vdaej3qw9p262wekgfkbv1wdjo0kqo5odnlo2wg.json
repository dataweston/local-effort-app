  "description": "In the opening take, Lee explains there was never a doubt that OU was going to beat West Virginia Friday night. Then Grant joins to randomly get excited about Minnesota Golden Gopher football and also deflect from the fact he picked against OU to win (4:05). For the first time in weeks we begin the show with the OU offense after the Sooners performed at an elite level once again (6:35). Lincoln Riley put the ball in Kyler's hands on 4th down and the game on the line deep in the 4th quarter, and the guys argue over the one Austin Seibert punt of the night (9:10). OU's offense kept their composure all night and came up with big play after big play (15:45). Marquise Brown was awesome against WVU and Lee thinks this game felt different than usual for the OU offense (19:30). Moving over to the defense where Grant thought that unit played one of its best games in weeks and the cornerbacks stood out (32:30). OU's going to need to find a way to improve pass coverage in the middle of the field and it was puzzling to see Caleb Kelly out there once on 3rd & 18 (39:15). There were a handful of guys who played really well including many on the defensive line (44:40). We get to the poor safety play including Bookie's rough game, although there were some positive takeaways (47:10). Although OU gave up more than 700 yards we don't feel as badly about this performance as other recent games (52:00). Is it possible that we're being too hard on the OU defense? And we talk about Michigan's defense if it played in the Big 12 (54:10). We get to your \\\"3 Word Reviews\\\" (59:20). A Texas rematch is up next and Lee's already watched back some of the last OU-Texas game (1:08:20). Tackling some listener questions/comments on OU's propensity for giving up big plays on 3rd & long, plus a look at the OU vs. Ohio State potential Playoff debate (1:12:50). Finally, if UGA beats Alabama in the SEC Championship does that mean both UGA and Bama makes the Playoff (1:23:30)? | Like the show on Facebook: @westofeverest | Follow Grant on Twitter: @GrantBenson25 | Follow Lee on Twitter: @LeeBensonNews9",
