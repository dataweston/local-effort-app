  "description": "Home economics programs are offered to students in grades 6-12 in the Des Moines INdependent Community School District (Iowa). Programs at the middle school level are exploratory, leading to occupational training in family and consumer science, child care, food service, and textile and fashion arts at the high school level. Health education programs emphasize personal health and wellness as well as provide training to become a practical nurse. Competency-based curriculum is offered in all home economics and health courses. Instruction includes laboratory and on-the-job training. Funds to support the home economics and health programs comes from district budgets, student fees, and state and federal vocational education reimbursement. The responsibility of the home economics/health supervisor is to promote the development, implementation, and evaluation of home economics programs and health programs at the secondary level. Home economics and health classes at the high school level are elective programs. Programs serve an average of 21 percent of the student body each semester, with male students making up 21 percent of the total home economics enrollment. New equipment has been added, and new facilities have been created for the child care, food service, and health careers programs at Central Campus. Future plans call for regular updating of curriculum and equipment, evaluation and updating of laboratory facilities, and expanded articulation with postsecondary institutions. (Appendices contain the following: course articulation diagram; outline of the human growth and development curriculum, listing content, grade level, course title, and whether required or elective; advisory committee report; and enrollment figures by school and course.)
