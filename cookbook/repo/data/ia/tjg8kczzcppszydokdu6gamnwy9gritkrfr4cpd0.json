  "description": "A remarkable 1,300-page document dump from the currently-quashed state criminal investigation into WI Gov. Scott Walker's illegal collusion with third-party groups during his 2012 recall election is, in many ways, jaw-dropping. As we discuss on today's show, in addition to that collusion, the leaked emails also reveal state GOP operatives preparing to declare massive Democratic voter fraud - without a shred of evidence - in order to win a very close 2011 election for a state Supreme Court Justice who would ultimately ensure a Walker-friendly majority on the court to support the Governor's controversial union-busting law. Brendan Fischer of the Campaign Legal Center joins us to discuss the several smoking guns revealed by the massive release of emails and other documents from the state's John Doe investigation of Walker and friends, after the probe was shut down by the same elected Justices on the state Supreme Court whose elections were funded by the exact same donors and illegal mechanisms revealed by the quashed documents...",
