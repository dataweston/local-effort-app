  "description": "Memory is a reconstructive process inherently vulnerable to external influences. The misinformation effect - a phenomenon extensively investigated in the context of eyewitness testimony - demonstrates how post-event information can distort the accuracy of memory recall. However, relatively little research has explored how misinformation affects the memory of tactile experiences and the evaluative interpretation of events from the perspective of the victim, i.e., the individual subjected to physical touch. The present study investigates the impact of misinformation on memory for touch in scenarios of forensic relevance, as well as on the evaluative judgments of such interactions when the participant assumes the role of the victim. Participants viewed a first-person perspective video depicting an interaction involving physical touch between a professor and a student ( i.e., a male professor interacting with a female student vs. a female professor interacting with a male student), with the point of view of the student, thereby positioning the participant as the recipient of the touch. Following the video, participants completed both free and cued recall tasks and responded to specific questions concerning the nature of the physical interaction. They also provided evaluative ratings (on a scale from 0 to 10) of the professor’s behavior in terms of intentionality, appropriateness, severity, the necessity for punishment, and severity of the punishment. After a 24-hour delay, participants read a narrative about the professor that was either neutral (e.g., the professor organizing materials for exams) or included misinformation (e.g., the professor being under university investigation for sexual harassment allegations). Participants were then asked to perform a second free recall and respond to the same cued questions as before. Given prior evidence suggesting a link between high levels of suggestibility and increased susceptibility to false confessions (Otgaar et al., 2021), interrogative suggestibility was measured using the Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale (GSS1; Gudjonsson, 1984). In addition, working memory (WM) was assessed through the forward and backward digit span tasks (WAIS; Wechsler, 1997), and executive functioning (EF) was evaluated using the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST; Heaton et al., 1997), in line with literature indicating that both WM and EF may serve as protective factors against the formation of false memories (Leding, 2012; Mirandola et al., 2017; Peters et al., 2007).",
