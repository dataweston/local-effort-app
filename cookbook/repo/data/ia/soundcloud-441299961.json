  "description": "Hour 1: No, Pat’s procedure was not as easy as the callers said it would be …A major #MeToo activist has been caught up in allegations of violence against women …Donald Trump actually predicted Eric Schneiderman’s downfall all the way back in 2013 …In Venezuela, prices for foodstuffs have skyrocketed to insane levels …The month of April saw the largest monthly budget surplus in the history of the U.S. Government …New Jersey baseball player sues coach for instructing him to slide, which led to him getting hurt …Another New Jersey school declares that there will be no more tryouts for the cheer team …Taylor Swift performs a private concert for 2000 foster kids, spends three hours signing autographs. Hour 2: Mexico mobilizes a deportation force to help secure its border with Guatemala …Flashback to President Felipe Calderón’s comments on detaining illegal aliens in his country …California student interrogated for wearing pro-gun rights flag to school ahead of planned walkout …Minnesota Senate debating removing motto of “In God we Trust” from school entrance – Pat says: if you don’t want to be offended by something, then don’t look at it …Pat drops a movie reference on you, the audience – Can you figure it out? …Cyclists deserve their space on the road, but they also need to obey basic traffic laws …Southlake, TX couple arrested on slavery charges for holding their servant captive for 18 years …There is no end in sight for Obamacare – It’s just not going to happen. Hour 3: Rudy Giuliani is definitely on his way out of President Trump’s inner circle …Is Melania Trump’s anti-bullying initiative a worthwhile effort? Or is it the same as Michelle Obama’s? …It turns out that women don’t actually make significantly less than men …Dissecting Alyssa Milano’s manifesto from her counter-protest at the NRA Convention …Caller says that Melania Trump has been bullied by the mainstream media about all kinds of things, so her initiative is more than appropriate …President Trump has announced that the U.S. will pull out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, which has further endeared him to the state of Israel …That said, his commentary on John McCain’s valor was absurd, and the Arizona senator was right to bar him from attending his funeral.
