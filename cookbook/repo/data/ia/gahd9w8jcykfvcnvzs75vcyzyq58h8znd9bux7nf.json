  "description": "Episode 11 of The Guillotine Grapevine features one of the top wrestling journalists in the country, Ben Pherson from the Rochester Post-Bulletin. Ben talks about how he gets the right stories to tell in the paper and how he's taken his passion for wrestling and worked it into his day-to-day job at the paper. Ben's got an interesting backstory, but the Minnesota State Championships have been a big part of it throughout his career. With newspapers constantly downsizing and sacrificing coverage for more national, cookie-cutter types of content, Ben's providing the local and state community with great features and coverage. We sit and chat with Ben, get off topic at times, but have some fun.
