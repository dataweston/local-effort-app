  "description": "John Peterson grew up loving wrestling out in the western part of Minnesota. With two twin brothers who excelled, it was easy for him to follow their opponents from around the state. As Peterson got older, he took his love for the sport and his passion for broadcasting and put them together. On Episode 42 of The Guillotine Grapevine, we talk to the Fertlie, Minn., native about his broadcasting career and how some graduate work at St. Cloud State led him to be named the National Wrestling Media Association's Broadcaster of the Year for 2017-18. There's a lot of chatter about wrestling in his home area, as well as near Bemidji State, where he attended school as an undergraduate.
