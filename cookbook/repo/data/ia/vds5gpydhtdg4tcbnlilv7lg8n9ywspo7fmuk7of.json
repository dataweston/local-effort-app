  "description": "Happy Monday! Sam and Emma speak with writer and labor organizer Mindy Isser to discuss the United Auto Workers (UAW) calling for a ceasefire in the Israel/Gaza conflict. First, Sam and Emma run through updates on the US vetoing a UN ceasefire resolution while sending more bombs to Israel, Biden's dropping poll numbers in Georgia and Michigan, the House GOP's impeachment process, the material impact of Texas' forced birth policy, the EU's AI policy, Saudi Arabia's crippling of COP28, Google's antitrust case, and Tucker's career pivot, before diving into continuing unrest toward Biden and US policy around the ethnic cleansing of Gaza. Mindy Isser then joins, diving right into the UAW's ongoing era of militant and persistent action to aptly represent and fight for their members, as emblemized by Shawn Fain's leadership and the union's continuing drive for expansion. Expanding on this, Isser walks through the UAW's recent choice to join a call for a ceasefire in Gaza, exploring how it fits into the union's history of standing on the right side of immoral conflicts, particularly when it comes to reflecting the stance of the vast numbers of arab auto workers in Michigan and the midwest. Wrapping up, Sam and Emma have Isser walk through the theoretical plan for this ceasefire campaign, and what to expect from the UAW's expansion plans moving forwards.And in the Fun Half: Sam and Emma parse through Shontel Brown's recent statements on accepting mass donations from anti-progressive groups like AIPAC and DMFI, the mass Palestinian opposition to Hamas before Israel's revamped ethnic cleansing campaign, and the arbitrary and disrespectful debates around what actually constitutes \\\"genocide.\\\" Jenna from Fremont highlights her recent discussion with Christians on trans rights, Greg from Albany discusses challenging Elise Sefanik, and Chris calls in to explore the complex state of geopolitics. The MR Crew watches Climate Defiance's most recent intervention, George Santos begins his TV campaign against corrupt NY representatives, and Eric Weinstein and Dave Rubin try to wriggle back into the mainstream with... religion, plus, your calls and IMs!Check out Mindy's piece on the UAW's call for a ceasefire here: https://inthesetimes.com/article/uaw-endorses-ceasefire-labor-gaza-israel-palestineCheck out a virtual screening of the movie \\\"Israelism\\\" tonight!: https://kinema.com/events/israelism-5bdinrCheck out an interview with Jenna in Fremont here!: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBdnag8yuMs&ab_channel=TooPunktoBeaHippieBecome a member at JoinTheMajorityReport.com: https://fans.fm/majority/joinSubscribe to the ESVN YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/esvnshowSubscribe to the AMQuickie newsletter here: https://am-quickie.ghost.io/Join the Majority Report Discord! http://majoritydiscord.com/Get all your MR merch at our store: https://shop.majorityreportradio.com/Get the free Majority Report App!: http://majority.fm/appCheck out today's sponsors:Cozy Earth: Here's my gift to YOU this holiday season.
