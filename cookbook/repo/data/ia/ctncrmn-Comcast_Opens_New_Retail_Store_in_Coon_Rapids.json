  "description": "A new Xfinity Store recently opened in Coon Rapids. It’s part of an effort by Comcast to be more responsive to its customers. “What a great day, we’re glad to be here,” said J.D. Keller, regional senior vice president for the Comcast Twin Cities Region. Several members of the MetroNorth Chamber of Commerce officially welcomed Comcast’s new Xfinity Store to the neighborhood with a ribbon cutting. In years past, if a Comcast customer needed help with their equipment, it often meant a drive to Brooklyn Park. “Our customers had to drive several miles just to get the products they need and to be taken care of,” Keller said. “So from a customer experience perspective, it’s the most important thing we can do is be closer to our customers.\" The Coon Rapids Xfinity Store is one of six new stores Comcast plans to open this year. The stores are staffed by trained technology specialists who can assist customers by getting the most from their products. They offer hands-on displays for all of the Xfinity products and services, including Xfinity Mobile. “So, we’ve got the new Apple phones as you can see,” said Keller. “(You’ve) got the ability to come in and change your service, upgrade your service and get your customer experience needs taken care of.” “ET phone home,” said Jordan Hurley, an account manager who oversees the new Xfinity Stores in Minnesota. Hurley was demonstrating the flagship product, X-1 operating system with the voice remote, which is like a search engine for your TV. “Say something in the voice remote you’d like to watch and with our X-1 platform it’s going to help you find that,” Hurley said. Last fall Comcast introduced a brand new video service for their Internet-only customers, called Xfinity Flex. “It’s a brand product right now, for the over-the-top users that just have internet only,” Keller said. It’s a video product that they can actually sign into these great streaming services through Flex.” “It gives you access to all of your streaming applications all in one area, but through our X-1 platform with our voice remote,” added Hurley. In April, Comcast plans to offer their own streaming service to Xfinity customers, called Peacock. Peacock is an over-the-top subscription video on demand streaming service by NBCUniversal, which is a subsidiary of Comcast. The service will be available, in July, for non-Xfinity customers. The Internet of things, currently on display at an Xfinity Store near you. The new Xfinity Store in Coon Rapids is located near the Cub Foods and Walmart in Riverdale. The store is open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. - 7 p.m. and Sundays from 11 a.m. - 5 p.m.",

      "description": "A new Xfinity Store recently opened in Coon Rapids. It’s part of an effort by Comcast to be more responsive to its customers.<br /><br />“What a great day, we’re glad to be here,” said J.D. Keller, regional senior vice president for the Comcast Twin Cities Region.<br /><br />Several members of the MetroNorth Chamber of Commerce officially welcomed Comcast’s new Xfinity Store to the neighborhood with a ribbon cutting. In years past, if a Comcast customer needed help with their equipment, it often meant a drive to Brooklyn Park.<br /><br />“Our customers had to drive several miles just to get the products they need and to be taken care of,” Keller said. “So from a customer experience perspective, it’s the most important thing we can do is be closer to our customers.\"<br /><br />The Coon Rapids Xfinity Store is one of six new stores Comcast plans to open this year. The stores are staffed by trained technology specialists who can assist customers by getting the most from their products. They offer hands-on displays for all of the Xfinity products and services, including Xfinity Mobile.<br /><br />“So, we’ve got the new Apple phones as you can see,” said Keller. “(You’ve) got the ability to come in and change your service, upgrade your service and get your customer experience needs taken care of.”<br /><br />“ET phone home,” said Jordan Hurley, an account manager who oversees the new Xfinity Stores in Minnesota. Hurley was demonstrating the flagship product, X-1 operating system with the voice remote, which is like a search engine for your TV.<br /><br />“Say something in the voice remote you’d like to watch and with our X-1 platform it’s going to help you find that,” Hurley said.<br /><br />Last fall Comcast introduced a brand new video service for their Internet-only customers, called Xfinity Flex.<br /><br />“It’s a brand product right now, for the over-the-top users that just have internet only,” Keller said. It’s a video product that they can actually sign into these great streaming services through Flex.”<br /><br />“It gives you access to all of your streaming applications all in one area, but through our X-1 platform with our voice remote,” added Hurley.<br /><br />In April, Comcast plans to offer their own streaming service to Xfinity customers, called Peacock. Peacock is an over-the-top subscription video on demand streaming service by NBCUniversal, which is a subsidiary of Comcast. The service will be available, in July, for non-Xfinity customers.<br /><br />The Internet of things, currently on display at an Xfinity Store near you.<br /><br />The new Xfinity Store in Coon Rapids is located near the Cub Foods and Walmart in Riverdale. The store is open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. - 7 p.m. and Sundays from 11 a.m. - 5 p.m.",
