  "description": "http://www.foxsports.com/wisconsin/story/bryan-bulaga-elects-to-re-sign-with-green-bay-packers-at-hometown-discount-031015 The Green Bay Packers've reached a deal with offensive lineman Bryan Bulaga. Bulaga'll sign a five-year deal worth just under 7 MILLION dollars per season, according to FOX Sports. It looks to be for a total of 34 MILLION, with about 11 MILLION guaranteed. It's widely regarded that Bulaga could've gotten much more from other teams. With some career backups like Jeremy Parnell signing a similar contract in Jacksonville, that seems to be true. Parnell is 28, and has just seven regular season starts to his name -- whereas Bulaga is 25 and has started in 48 NFL games. Last season, Bulaga was rated by ProFootballFocus as the NFL's second-best pass-blocking right tackle. Overall among right tackles, he was rated fourth at his position.",
