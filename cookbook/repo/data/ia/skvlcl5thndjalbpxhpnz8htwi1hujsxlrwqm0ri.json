  "description": "Today's Rapid Response episode takes a look at two pressing issues: (1) Mueller's [REDACTED] sentencing memorandum with respect to Michael Flynn, and (2) the naked power grab by lame-duck Republicans in Wisconsin. Along the way, we'll also cover a bunch more legal stories, but you knew that already! We begin high atop Yodel Mountain, where we cover not only the [REDACTED] Flynn memorandum but also Roger Stone taking 5 and a truly bizarre conspiracy theory advanced by Rudy Giuliani. Then, it's time for the main segment, in which we tackle Wisconsin SB 887 and its component bills that are designed to weaken drastically the strength of the incoming Democratic governor, Tony Evers. Is it as bad as everyone says it is? (It's worse.) After that, it's time for a brief Andrew Was Wrong segment. Turns out Andrew Was Wrong about both Julian Assange and American paddlefish! Finally, we end with an all new Thomas Takes The Bar Exam #102 on evidence and the admissibility of hearsay. Find out how Thomas outsources the decision and more. And, of course, if you'd like to play along with us, just retweet our episode on Twitter or share it on Facebook along with your guess and the #TTTBE hashtag. We'll release the answer on next Tuesday's episode along with our favorite entry! Appearances Andrew was recently a guest on the David Pakman show talking court-packing and more. Give it a listen!
