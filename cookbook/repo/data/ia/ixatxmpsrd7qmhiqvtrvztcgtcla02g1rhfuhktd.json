  "description": "This is Coronavirus 411, the latest on Omicron and other COVID variants and new hotspots for December 15th, 2021. Just one month after it was first detected in South Africa the CDC says Omicron now makes up about 3% of cases in the U.S. Delta still dominates at 97% of all Covid cases analyzed, but Omicron is gaining ground. It's getting cloudier when the U.S. even had its first Omicron case. But the CDC confirmed Omicron in a symptomatic patient back on November 15.  No matter the variant, the virus seems to spread with relative ease and here's one possible reason why. New published research shows more than 40% of those who tested positive didn't have symptoms. For those under 20, the number is more than 60%. That means the virus had plenty of time and plenty of opportunity to spread undetected and untested.  Africa is experiencing its fastest surge in cases this year, up 83%. And while we often hear about African nations not getting fair access to vaccines, Nigeria had one million doses that expired and were thrown out. And they aren't going to accept any more vaccines with short shelf lives. Nigeria is Africa's most populous nation.  Italy is now requiring any unvaccinated visitor from another EU country to quarantine for five days after arriving. Those visitors from EU countries must get a negative test within 24 hours of arrival, and non-EU citizens who aren't vaccinated have to quarantine 10 days. It's also expanding the vaccine mandate to school personnel, law enforcement, the military and anyone working in a health care setting.  But in the U.K., they're removing all 11 African nations from its red list just 16 days after it was reintroduced. But not because things are going well. The Health Secretary said Omicron has now spread so far the rules really no longer serve the purpose of COVID-19 prevention.  In the United States cases were up 47%, deaths are up 40%, and hospitalizations are up 21% over 14 days. The 7-day average of new cases has been trending up since November 29.  The five states that had the most daily deaths per 100,000 are Michigan, Montana, Arizona, Kentucky, and Wisconsin.   There are 10,075,594 active cases in the United States. The five states with the greatest increase in hospitalizations per capita: Connecticut 72%, New Jersey 66%, North Carolina 63%, Washington DC 59%, and Massachusetts and Delaware 54%.  The top 10 counties with the highest number of recent cases per capita according to The New York Times: Allen, KS. Seward, KS. Pike, IL. Piatt, IL. Aroostook, ME. Piscataquis, ME. Fulton, PA. Clay, IL. Jefferson, IN. And Mason, IL. There have been at least 800,343 deaths in the U.S. recorded as Covid-related. The top 3 vaccinating states by percentage of population that's been fully vaccinated: Vermont at 75.2%, Rhode Island at 74.8%, and Maine at 74.1%. The bottom 3 vaccinating states are Idaho at 45.8%, Wyoming at 46.4%, and Alabama at 46.9%. The percentage of the U.S. that's been fully vaccinated is 60.9%. Globally, cases were up 6% and deaths down 1% over 14 days, with the 7-day average trending up since October 15.  There are 22,157,993 active cases around the world. The five countries with the most new cases: The United States 108,566. France 63,405. The U.K. 59,610. Germany 40,795. And Russia 28,343. There have been at least 5,320,236 deaths reported as Covid-related worldwide.  For the latest updates, subscribe for free to Coronavirus 411 on your podcast app or ask your smart speaker to play the Coronavirus 411 podcast.
