      "title": "Seeds of Discontent, episode 13 (African American middle class)",
      "transcript": "Speaker 0    00:00:03    This is the 13th and a series of programs, entitled seeds of discontent here to present the program as Hartford Smith, Jr. Supervisor of the screening and intake unit maintained by the Michigan department of social services, delinquency rehabilitation programs, Mr. Smith   Speaker 1    00:00:19    On tonight's program, seeds of discontent continues its examination of the problems, feelings, and attitudes of American Negroes, who today constitute one of the largest discontented forces in American society. We are attempting to do this by establishing a dialogue with different Negroes from various walks of life. So far in our programs on this general American problem, you've heard the comments and expressions of feelings about the plight of the Negro from older Negro citizens who were employed in many common areas of economic activity. You have also heard the comments and concerns are Negros occupying leading positions in the field of entertainment. Our specific area of focus tonight will be the attitude, feelings, and concerns of the Negro from the ranks of what might be called the middle class. This particular classification is a rather vague one and is subject to great elasticity shades of meaning and negative connotations.   Speaker 1    00:01:22    When applied to a Negro. This is undoubtably due to the fact that middle classness and maintaining the status quo are often viewed as the same by many in society, which of course then means that if you are middle-class, you are for maintaining things as they are, which then includes all of the injustice and suffering, which is the flip side of the status quo and our use of the term middle-class Negro. We simply mean those Negroes occupying status positions, which are recognized as being within the ranks or what has been classified as the middle class in the society. At large, we will leave it to them to say whether or not they are for maintaining the status quo. As participants on tonight's program, we have a Negro car salesman and Negro psychologist, and I need grow editor of a weekly newspaper. We invited them to talk with us regarding their own general backgrounds, some of the problems that they have faced and to give us their impressions and feelings concerning the series of riots or rebellions that have occurred in American society.   Speaker 1    00:02:36    In recent years, these areas of concern should provide some preliminary insights into their feelings and attitudes about the problems of the Negro and American society of these problems can be seen, heard, and perhaps better understood before our discussion gets underway. I should like to provide a little background information about our participants. Mr. Orien warden is a psychologist and works at the university of Windsor. Mr. Lenny Heslop is a car salesman for leading automobile dealer and the city of Detroit, Mr. Aja Dunmore is an editor of the Michigan Chronicle. One of the largest Negro weekly in the country. He has been in the newspaper business for many years and at one time was the editor of another Negro weekly called the Pittsburgh courier. We will open with general background comments by Mr. Warden, followed by Mr. Haslip. And lastly, Mr. Dunmore,   Speaker 2    00:03:34    My name is Dorian warden and I'm a psychologist. I work at the university of Windsor and the job over there is coordinator of psychological services center. And I teach a part-time faculty at Wayne university.   Speaker 3    00:03:57    Were you born and reared in this country?   Speaker 2    00:04:01    The America? Yes. I'm from a little town in south Eastern, Arkansas, Mariana and family lived there until I was eight years old and we moved from there to Southern Illinois. And that's where,   Speaker 3    00:04:20    Um, a small town in Arkansas and looking at the position that you occupying now, um, uh, certainly it seems to be a vast difference, I would imagine. And the, uh, how many, uh, social styles, um, the level of living. I wonder if you could tell us about, uh, any of the special problems and, and leaving, uh, the community of Arkansas and moving to where you are today in your present position?   Speaker 2    00:04:55    Well, that certainly is true that a vast differences in, uh, experiences and styles and, uh, behavior on my part and, uh, people that I now live and work with as I remember, uh, the early kinds of experiences that, uh, my family and my father and, and other relatives talked about, uh, their experiences to be in Arkansas. Uh, of course being eight years old when I left a lot of the things, uh, are these kinds of remembrances for me, you know, things that they would talk about more than actual experiences. Um, if you'd been in the south growing up or lived in the south, you know, that, uh, Negros in the south live in one part of town and that's pretty much the, uh, the world that I knew. And until I left, because going uptown or downtown, whatever it was called was the only experience I would have with white people. I have,   Speaker 3    00:06:04    I left the cell moving north and, uh, and, uh, getting your, your educational training. Um, and then later on becoming a psychologist, uh, were there any special problems, any barriers, any, any thing of special concern to you now as you look back at it?   Speaker 2    00:06:28    Um, no, I, I can't say, uh, the kinds of dramatic and specific things that occurred in my life. Um, uh, you know, with this kind of a focus, I, uh, when we moved to Illinois, it was a small town in Southern Illinois, Carol, and, uh, this was a segregated community and, uh, went through high school. I'm the only girl high school. And, uh, this experience was, uh, from a social and psychological point of view, uh, you know, quite supportive, I would say of, uh, feelings about, uh, myself as a growing teenager and the kind of participation opportunities that, uh, I had. So there's a lot of emotional supports built in I, as I look back on what happened later in my life to that period, which was, uh, one that has a lot of, uh, strength for me in it, uh, after leaving Illinois at that part of Illinois and going to school up in central Illinois, that was the first time I'd ever had any, uh, experiences with white people and close way, like going to school with them and being in different, uh, competitive activities.   Speaker 2    00:07:46    And, uh, this was the thing that I guess I had my uppermost in my mind when I went away from this little town in Southern Illinois was, you know, uh, it was, my education is good, uh, as, as there's a, can I do the work as well as they can? So this is something that almost like I had to prove that to myself, that, uh, I could achieve and, and compete given the kind of, uh, educational background that I had, which I thought was pretty good. And it turned out apparently that it was pretty good because I did find myself able to compete and compete quite adequately. And in favorably,   Speaker 3    00:08:30    Mr. Al slope, I wonder if we could just get started by giving some general background information about yourself?   Speaker 4    00:08:40    Well, I was born here in Detroit. Um, I lived on the west side of town. Most of my life. I, a salesman married had one child.   Speaker 3    00:08:55    What'd you tell us, and the years that you've lived in Detroit, uh, just a little bit about, um, any of the personal things that have happened to you and the whole area of the, the problem of the American Negro. And I noticed that you are a he new car salesman. Um, as I recall, uh, it was only been in recent years, or maybe we were not aware of it, then the Negroes, uh, were involved in this field. Um, it's true,   Speaker 4    00:09:31    Um, up until about 10 years ago, and there were only a half a dozen Negros selling automobiles. And then there are some dealerships today that, um, don't eat meat implementing grows. I mean, I think there's one particular dealership. I don't suppose I should mention the names now, but there is one particular, uh, group of dealerships, um, where Negroes buy, I'd say 50% of the well-to-do Negroes in Detroit purchaser, automobiles, um, have one Negro salesman.   Speaker 3    00:10:08    Are there any, um, peculiar reasons, uh, that you are aware of where this is state of affairs?   Speaker 4    00:10:18    Well, it's hard to put your hand down. I was talking to a friend of mine here a few months ago, and it was an automobile salesman and, uh, he just do satisfies on thought on this. He made a trip to each one of these dealerships throughout the city. And, um, the same excuse. I mean, the excuses that he got from each dealership was just about the same as if they didn't have room. Um, they had a lot of salesmen. They couldn't use them, or they would get in touch with them later on about it. Um, this was over a course of about six or seven months. And, um, I think he made a return trip to several of dealerships and got the same story.   Speaker 3    00:11:05    How long have you been entrenched in and, uh, the, um, in the new car sales spiel and where there any particular problems, uh, in your case in getting involved in this line of work.   Speaker 4    00:11:21    And that was the time that I went in, which was about three years ago. Um, nigga was fairly fast and those into the sales field, and as far as automobiles are concerned, I really didn't have any problems getting into the sales field as far as bills are concerned. I, um, I had thought about it for a number of years, but, uh, some of the things that I've heard, you know, about a lot build sales, my, uh, I didn't particularly want to get into it at the time. But then, um, later on I talked to a good friend of mine that had been selling cars, had been doing quite well. And I thought that I'd just give it a try and just see how things would work out. And, um, I haven't experienced any, uh, derogatory, um, things in the sales field up to now, but I do know that, uh, there was very little chance of investment as fascinate is concerned,   Speaker 3    00:12:22    Other than, um, at this particular area. I wonder if you would just mention briefly any, uh, special problems, uh, which you feel you faced, uh, as an American Negro, um, making a living and living in American society.   Speaker 4    00:12:46    Well, I, both you and your family have run into problems, especially in the sales fields. There were certain areas of the sales field that I was interested in and, uh, the insurance field was one of them. And at the time that, uh, I was interested in getting into the insurance field, there just weren't any openings outside of the small Negro insurance companies. Uh, I went to one particular large one, one of the largest in the country. And, uh, they have certain methods of testing you at 90% of the, uh, um, tests that I did the, they give you, uh, it's impossible to, um, pass. Uh, I know one reason I, uh, I was asked, uh, how much insurance I had and at the time all I had was this, uh, GI, which I had labs. And, um, we, we couldn't go any further. This, this was the end of it. Uh, but now of course today, things have changed. I mean, all your major, major, uh, insurance companies, um, employing Negroes. And I still think this is a, still to me, uh, a token gesture. And so far as insurances or insurance selling is missing. Mr.   Speaker 3    00:14:14    I've done the more, I wonder if for the benefit of radio audience, you could give us some background information about yourself. I know you have been a newspaper man for man for many years and wonder how long now you got your start. And, uh, like for you talk a little bit about, uh, any special problems that have, that have affected you or, uh, anything to that have happened to you as, as a human being, as an American Negro.   Speaker 5    00:14:45    Well, I, um, began and those paperwork and Philadelphia and 1937, I actually began writing in front of his paper as a teen calmness where a high school, while I was still in high school in Philadelphia, back in 1933, I later went to a, a, a college, which was at that time, totally Negro, as far as the stupid body was concerned, Hampton Institute and majored in social studies and English. This was during the Heights of the depths of the depression. However, you want to look at it. And in 1937, I decided to go into newspaper work rather than to feel of school teaching, because it was available to me. I always fancied that I've wanted to enter some kind of profession that would help stimulate the thought processes of people. I've always wanted to be able to motivate people and doing the best that they could with their talents and this more than anything else influenced me and to right-hand.   Speaker 5    00:16:06    And I, and, uh, although my career has been spent more in the field of editing rather than writing per se, I've been fortunate enough to have trained X number of highly capable journalists. Some have gone on to bigger things I have worked with and a number of outstanding people from my start in Philadelphia with a weekly Negro weekly, I joined the staff of the Pittsburgh chorea and 1943 at the time, it was the leading Negro Jernar or the leading journal Negro in America. And I was fortunate enough to be involved in many campaigns, which boy fro fruition, the, uh, elimination of the racial barrier and organized baseball. I was the anchor man for a crew who traveled with Jackie Robinson during his early years into the entrance, into organized baseball. I also played a role in the reporting and actually the setting up of stories have led to the elimination of discrimination in the armed forces.   Speaker 5    00:17:25    I worked closely with, um, James Evans and the Pentagon. He was a civilian aide to the secretary of defense. In fact, he still holds that position. And I was in on the breaking up of Lockbourne air base, the all Negro 332nd, um, squadron, which, um, was the all legal air arm commander, uh, by O Davis with, at that time was Lieutenant Colonel, as you know, he is now a Lieutenant general and, uh, a key man and strategic and the strategic air force. But, um, these were some of the things that I was able to participate in through the handling of stories, to the reporting of activity and through, um, reporting and gathering together forces to protest those things what's existed in and try to encourage the powers that be, and to recognizing the need for the elimination of segregation in these areas   Speaker 3    00:18:35    As a Negro, newspaperman working for a Negro weekly. Were there any special problems that you faced in getting the kind of material to get to the public, to, to present, uh, the kinds of facts, uh, and the places that you wanted to present? The,   Speaker 5    00:18:55    I don't think I had too many problems as far as a painting the facts, they just came to me and they were so obvious that it was a little difficult for me to publish a letter happened that I came along at a time that the stories that I was publishing were effectively used,   Speaker 3    00:19:13    Um, white, um, dailies, if you will, if I can call them white, uh, the regular daily newspapers at that time, how did they respond to, um, uh, Negro weeklies in those days? Did they give much credence to their material? Was there a general, a reciprocal kind of exchange of information, or were there any special problems in terms of, of getting real facts into say, daily   Speaker 5    00:19:44    Newspapers resistant? What, uh, we considered facts and knocked on the Negro week as a sort of a stepchild, although, um, they began to invade the ranks of Negro newspapers as these victories began to be one and off times headlines, which we ran were reprinted in the daily newspapers, but these crusades were never picked up seriously by the daily newspapers until the fact was accomplished, witnessed the Jackie Robinson incident, um, the series of articles written by Wendell Smith. And when she interviewed big league managers as to whether or not they would utilize, they would use Negro ballplayers and what they thought about legal well players, these matters were commented on that. They've impressed, but they didn't pick it up with the vigor that the Pittsburgh Cory did. And they looked at us as a sort of a, uh, well, the agitators really, we were agitated as, although they did get, give some treatment.   Speaker 5    00:20:47    They did not try to read what we were saying. You see as was, as far as the military episodes were concerned, but I don't think that there was a consciousness of what was trying to be done. If you can recall. Probably the boy caught at Briggs stadium when the Negroes of this community boycotted break scape, they did because they did not utilize Negro ball players. And I don't think the daily papers pay too much attention to it, but the, the, the management did. And ultimately they brought in first one, they broke news book player. Now it's almost a matter of fact, the Negro ballplayers are, are involved with professional football. I mean, in baseball, but these, um, initial attempts were almost ignored by the daily newspapers, however, men who involved themselves. So these kinds of crusades were ultimately picked up by the way, presses Wendell Smith was picked up by the cycle through them Tribune. Bill Matney was also picked up by the Detroit news and bill Matt, and he played a major role in the protest against discrimination. Eric bring stadium, you'll see, and these kinds of things were done. And, um, uh, the newspaper men who were brought to the attention where they were picked up, but I don't think the stories as such were picked up as real honest, forthright protest movements until the fact was accomplished.   Speaker 3    00:22:17    I see   Speaker 1    00:22:19    The following comments by these three men represent only preliminary answers to the questions, asked about the cause of recent riots or rebel.   Speaker 3    00:22:30    The during lane past three years, our country has been faced with a number of crises in terms of racial relations. Um, some writers have described, uh, these crises as riots. Uh, some have described them as rebellions. There does not seem to be total agreement on exactly what they are, but looking at these crisis he's, um, from your point of view, as a psychologist, as an American Negro and as an American citizen, uh, what do you think are some of the basic causes or what seems to be happening, uh, uh, that leads to the kinds of, uh, explosive situations that we've had in this country in the last three years?   Speaker 2    00:23:22    Oh, the causes has to do with, uh, the conditions in which, uh, you know, black people in this country live and to more or less degree conditions in which all non-white people in this country live, all minorities that are cultural and racial minorities in this country. And that means specifically, uh, um, bad housing, poor, inadequate housing, bad healthcare, uh, that public facilities, public services, education, jobs, housing, you know, you name it, uh, and up to a point, uh, these things can be contained, but, uh, at point apparently it was reached, uh, in terms of a, you know, of an active ferment back in, uh, 60 and 61, what was going on in the south. So the exposures in the cities are a continuation to the same kind of thing. People just start aware that life can be something other than what it is now. And, uh, this is kind of a revolutionary idea in a sense it's been going on around the world for decades, that, uh, the old arrangements of, um, of power and people who were powerless, uh, are no longer tenable. And so we have that saying, I feel the same thing happening here in this country. The power arrangements are now under, uh, attack in a sense,   Speaker 3    00:24:58    I wonder if you would just give us, uh, any impressions that you have about these recent rebellions of Ryans from the point of view of causation, um, from the point of view of why it occurred, or just your general impressions of what this is all about? Well,   Speaker 4    00:25:19    I am, he believes these riots that do come about, uh, last summer and in a couple of years ago. And once, uh, it was a result of frustrations on the Negro part, I mean, a sort of a, a hopelessness that he feels, and he seems that he's backed into a corner and, uh, you can back the most <inaudible> person or even an animal into a corner. And if he sees no way out, he's going to fight, he's bound to fight. And I think this has been the case, um, uh, they felt that this was just no help. The America has just let them down for 400 years. And if the, uh, uh, the problems that they have, um, when never gonna be solved   Speaker 3    00:26:22    As a Negro newspaper, man, um, you certainly, haven't been in touch with the Negro community for a number of years, uh, from the point of view of analyzing events, reporting events, and looking at the why's of the past. And I wonder if you would share with us your thoughts and, uh, your   Speaker 1    00:26:43    Impression of what has happened the last three years, what are some of the causes? What are some of the reasons issues?   Speaker 5    00:26:52    Well, one of the fundamental reasons is that the American white still does not want to regard the American black as a human being. Now that's probably over simplifying it and being a little bit too Frank, but, uh, I just finished, um, reading a book called eyewitness to American history. And as early as 1837, uh, David Walker told a group of whites and Boston that all you have to do is treat the black man, like a man, treat us like a man. And then we can be your friends. You see? And, uh, I thought that this was so apropos that even today, the white man wants to deal with the Negro. He wants to be, he wants to be liberal, but he doesn't really understand the meaning of the quantity. He cannot shed from himself, this attitude that because a man skin is black or even tinted that he's got to be an inferior B.   Speaker 5    00:28:04    Now I do not believe that the white man consciously wants to accept the black man as an equal and only level. Now he tries to be tolerant. He tries to be understanding you see, he doesn't understand why the word tolerance is a word, the incense, the thinking Negro, the thinking of black man. He doesn't understand the strong of a dignity. He always wants to talk about you. People see aren't you people satisfied with what you have to see instead of understanding that this is an American problem that liberals want to be Americans do. And if they are accepted as Americans and that considered on the basis of the fact that Jesus had Negro first and American, secondly, until the white man recognizes this, that if the whole attitude car can be eliminated, I think that we, we won't get to the root of the situation until this matter of color is eliminated. The fact that, uh, that because the Negro is identifiable, that this identification is used to put him into a completely different classification. You see, he's got to accept a man because he's a man. And not because he's a black man or a white man or a yellow man,   Speaker 1    00:29:23    We will continue discussions with Mr. Dunmore, Mr. Haslam, and Mr. Warden on the riots and other subjects on next week's program. In closing, I should like to add that much has been said and written about the middle-class American Negro and the role that he has played in the current of discontent. He has been called an uncle, Tom, a stooge and many other uncomplimentary names. He has been accused of being insensitive to the needs of the Negro and American society. It has been said that once the middle-class Negro finds his niche, he tends to forget about the problems of those left behind and the ghetto. Although our examination is not complete as yet. I think that the remarks that these gentlemen have made about themselves and their preliminary remarks regarding causation suggest many common threads of thought and concern, which are evident throughout the remarks of other Negroes from other walks of life, many of their statements are consistent with statements and concerns expressed by both the older Negro citizens and the performing artists who have discussed some of the problems with us on early programs. Yeah,   Speaker 0    00:30:38    You've just heard Hartford Smith, junior supervisor of the screening and intake unit maintained by the Michigan department of social services.
