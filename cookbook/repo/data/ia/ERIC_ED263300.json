  "description": "In 1982, females constituted 51.1 percent of those students enrolled in secondary vocational education courses in Minnesota; however, they accounted for only 40 percent of those enrolled in area vocational-technical institutes. If vocational programs are defined as being either segregated or integrated on the basis of whether fewer or more than 80 percent of the students enrolled in them belong to one sex, then, in 1982, 47.1 percent of the state's secondary vocational programs were segregated and 47.7 were integrated. The other 5.2 percent had enrollment patterns in which more than 80 percent of the enrollees were of the sex that is considered nontraditional for that particular occupational area. Followup data collected 1 year after the graduation of Minnesota's high school class of 1981 revealed that average earnings for male vocational graduates were $4.45 per hour as compared with $3.94 per hour for female vocational graduates. (This report contains discussions, graphs, and tables detailing enrollment patterns in special needs and general agricultural, distributive, health occupations, home economics, office occupations, technical, and trade and industrial education programs.)
