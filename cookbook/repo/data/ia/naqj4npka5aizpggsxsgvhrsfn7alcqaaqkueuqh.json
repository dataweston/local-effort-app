  "description": "On this episode of the Adventures of Pipeman, Pipeman is joined by GFM, live from Blue Ridge Festival, live from Virginia International Raceway, Virginia. Pipeman and GFM start by talking about the monstrous walk which needs to be done to get to catering. GFM decided not to and eat tuna packets from their car, while Pipeman had to do the whole walk in the rain. They're not the only ones complaining, as the photographers have said they want to make a shirt saying F that hill. It's not just the walk that's causing problems at Blue Ridge as at Slipknot's set, Corey had to stop 4 times with people getting hurt thanks to the mud which is effecting the people in the pits. Speaking about what it's like to be back and performing, they say it didn't feel like the year of 2021 actually existed, but they're super stoked that people waited for three years and still wanted to see their shows after the pandemic. They go on to talk about some of the challenges they faced during that enforced time away from performing, as well as the benefits of being able to step off the hamster wheel and focus on the music. The guys talk about how lucky they are that the pandemic happened during the time of internet so they could still promote and put content out, but if it happened 20-30 years ago, a lot of bands wouldn't be able to survive. After Blue Ridge, the guys have a festival coming up called Uprisings, and then they go on the Save The World Fozzy tour, where they'll be focusing on the Midwest which is cool for them as that's where they're from originally.
