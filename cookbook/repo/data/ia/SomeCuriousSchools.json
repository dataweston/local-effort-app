Faber , Illustrator-Civil War medical, portrait. Pennsylvania / Germany (1832 - 1913) This book is considered a \"Wide Awake's\" story book. And it specifically addresses \"Wide Awakes\" throughout the book The Wide Awakes were a youth organization and, later, a paramilitary organization cultivated by the Republican Party during the 1860 presidential election in the United States. Using popular social events, an ethos of competitive fraternity, and even promotional comic books, the organization introduced many to political participation and proclaimed themselves the newfound voice of younger voters. The structured, militant Wide Awakes appealed to a generation profoundly shaken by the partisan instability of the 1850s and offered young northerners a much-needed political identity.
