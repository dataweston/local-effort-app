  "description": "This final report discusses the administration, staffing, planning, implementation and evaluation of the SPEAC (Student Parent Educator Administrator Children) for Nutrition Program. The principle objective of the program is to provide nutrition education and increased understanding of the role of the Child Care Food Program through increased opportunities for preschool children to participate in nutrition related learning activities. The program was designed to (1) improve the preschooler's dietary habits, (2) increase parent's, teacher's and others awareness of nutritional needs, (3) increase participation in child nutrition programs, and (4) integrate nutrition education into existing preschool curricula. Field test sites in which the program was implemented include two family day care homes, 16 child care centers and eight public school early childhood home economics and/or parent education programs in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Program implementation involved the integration of a nutrition curriculum into existing programs, workshops for parents, cooks, and field test site participants, inservice training to describe the program and provide feedback to field test participants, and the dissemination of program results to community agencies and professionals. Project materials, including a literature review, an annotated bibliography, a curriculum and a slide/tape presentation, as well as evaluation instruments were developed. Evaluation results indicate the program was effective in increasing participation in and understanding of nutrition education activities. Related materials such as curriculum writing and site selection procedures are appended. (Author/RH)",
