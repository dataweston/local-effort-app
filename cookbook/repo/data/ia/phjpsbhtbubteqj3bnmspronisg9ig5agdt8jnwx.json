  "description": "This week, Drewby and Yergy discuss the case of Autumn Lee Hallow, a young girl from Minnesota who became a victim of the pandemic... but not because she had fallen ill. Her father, Brett Hallow, and her new stepmother, Sarah Kay Nasby, kept little Autumn away from her mother, Kelsey, and blamed it on the pandemic. On August 13th, 2020, paramedics were called to the couple's apartment after Autumn was found unresponsive. Brett and Sarah claimed that the little girl had simply drown in the bathtub, however, her body told a very different story... as did the security cameras the couple had installed all over their home. Support Our Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/themiserymachinePayPal: https://www.paypal.me/themiserymachineJoin Our Facebook Group: https://t.co/DeSZIIMgXs?amp=1Instagram: miserymachinepodcastTwitter: misery_podcastDiscord: https://discord.gg/kCCzjZM#themiserymachine #podcast #truecrimeSource Material:https://kstp.com/kstp-news/top-news/a-pattern-of-abuse-investigation-reveals-warning-signs-long-before-8-year-olds-murder/https://people.com/crime/autumn-hallow-police-called-30-times-home-before-death/https://people.com/crime/autumn-hallow-minnesota-girl-dad-girlfriend-accused-murder/https://kstp.com/5-investigates/court-records-mother-pleaded-for-months-to-see-daughter-prior-to-death-in-elk-river/https://kstp.com/kstp-news/top-news/new-study-of-maltreatment-deaths-critical-of-minnesotas-child-welfare-system/https://www.monitorsaintpaul.com/stories/failed-by-family-court,5699https://www.hometownsource.com/elk_river_star_news/memorial-bench-donated-in-autumn-s-name/article_d11bb66a-1760-11ec-8245-2f54b3992845.htmlhttps://oxheadpsychology.com.au/thieves-in-the-temple-the-importance-of-identifying-scapegoating-in-family-systems-2/https://www.verywellmind.com/what-does-it-mean-to-be-the-family-scapegoat-5187038https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93AzpRPrtmwhttps://www.spreaker.com/user/sufferthelittlechildrenpod/83-autumn-hallow-part-2https://www.hometownsource.com/elk_river_star_news/memorial-bench-donated-in-autumn-s-name/article_d11bb66a-1760-11ec-8245-2f54b3992845.htmlhttps://www.daresfuneralservice.com/obituary/Autumn-Hallowhttps://www.facebook.com/kelsey.kruse.3",
