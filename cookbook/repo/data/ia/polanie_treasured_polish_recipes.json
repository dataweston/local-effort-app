  "description": "9th Edition of Treasured Polish Recipes for Americans by the Polanie Club of Minneapolis, Minnesota. The cookbook was first published in 1948. In addition to recipes of Polish Cooking, the book has many vignettes of pre-war (WWII) life and customs in Poland, as retold by both Polish expatriates and their American descendants. Most, if not all, are from women’s perspectives. Appended to the scan of the book is some additional information about the Polanie Club itself, surfaced during researching the copyright (work appears to be Public Domain), along with this metadata and detail about this copy of the book. The PDF was scanned with a CZUR scanner and its’ software was used to straighten and enhance the pages (i.e., make it more readable and accessible), making all inner pages high-contrast. The straightening effect is inconsistent. There is a photographic copy, with dustjacket, already available as a loan via https://archive.org/details/treasuredpolishr00pola",
