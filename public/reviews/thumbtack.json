    "quote": "Weston freaking (he’s going to make me curse) Smith!! Let me just start out by saying this review is an honest assessment. My wife and I do not know Weston outside of cooking. Aside from being responsive, attentive to our dietary restrictions (GF and DF) and punctual to the meet, Weston was the best decision I could’ve made for my wife’s birthday. He has a light presence to him and he’s very thoughtful in his approach. Not only is he very easy to talk to, he uses local ingredients sourced from Minnesota and Wisconsin. He started out by making us a duck appetizer. We both have never had duck before and let me tell you, it definitely won’t be our last time, either. We’ve already made a couple phone calls to our immediate community to talk about the duck appetizer and to start planning our next visit with him. He then made a Hanger steak taco entree that was divine. Best tacos in town. The meat was extremely tender, the ingredients were fresh and to top it all off. . We had left overs. He followed up with some chicken wings as a special request from us and they were amazing! I wish we would have gotten a chance to try his homemade ranch, (I’m a fan of ranch) but the chicken did not need it to be exactly what we wanted it to be. He made a chocolate cake to top off the night with his house blend whip crème and my goodness it was delightful. I can’t speak enough on how great he paired all of the flavors of every dish. He cleaned up after himself and there’s a reason why Weston Smith is #1",
